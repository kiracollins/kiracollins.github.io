							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the 4 Gestalt principles: emergence, reification, multi-stability, and invariance, proximity, common region, similarity, closure, symmetry, continuation, and common fate principles. I found the similarity principle - which says, in relation to UI design, that we tend to interpret similar elements to be grouped- particularly interesting. Similar colors, shapes, sizes, and orientations can convey similarity and therefore grouping. Furthermoe, some types of attributes (e.g. color) are more communitive than others (e.g. shape). </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really like how the article used images to convey their points. I uncerstood, but couldn't really picture the principles they described in the text. But simple illustrations were quite effective. My personal favorites were the dalmatian outlined only by its spots, and the circles placed closer together in columns appearing to belong to a group, even if they were the same size and color as other circles.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "People tend to identify elements first in their general outlined form. Our brain recognises a simple, well-defined object quicker than a detailed one." and "People will often interpret ambiguous objects in more than one ways. Our brains will bounce back and forth between the alternatives seeking certainty. As a result, one view will become more dominant while the other one will get harder to see." were both super interesting parts of Gestalt principles. </p>
